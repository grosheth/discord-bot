# Discord Bot



So I made a discord bot for me and my friends. It's full of inside jokes(most of it of bad taste) and also has a few functionnalities.

I was bad at coding when I began this project, still am. So expect bugs. I will eventually cleanup the code. 

I know, the code is definitely not perfect and will not work out of the box so don't forget to look at Missing parts section
